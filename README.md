# Validation

In the index.php file:
Have a webform that asks for email, phone number, zip code, and has a submit & reset button.
When submitted it will send the data to the process.php file.

In the process.php file:
Using PHP, retrieve the data via the POST from the index.php page.
Use regular expression techniques and function(s) to validate the phone number and email address.

If the data is valid, then display a message on the screen that includes the data along with a "thank you" message stating that the data is valid.
Be sure to include the data in the output.

If the data does not validate, then do the following:
Return to the index.php page.
On the index.php display an error message that is appropriate for the mistake.
Retain (in the input boxes) the original data entered in the fields so that the user doesn't have to completely retype everything.
